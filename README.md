I will create a Social Network of characters using Network Analytics. We will create a network graph of all the characters and will try to answer the following questions.
- What are the most important characters ?
- How their importance evolves over time ?
- Main communities in the network ?

For named entity recognition we will be using spacy NLP library, for analysing the network we will use networkx and for visualization we will use gravis.
